## General Description for the system


### Context and current situation

The University of Costa Rica seeks to innovate in how it presents itself to students and the general public through immersive technologies. Currently, exploring the campus relies on in-person visits or static websites, which limits access for many people.

Given the advancement of technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), it is essential for the university to be prepared for these changes. Initiatives like ThemePark@UCR help address this transformation by providing a more accessible, educational, and interactive experience.

### Solved problem

Access to information about the university, its spaces, services, and academic programs is limited in terms of interactivity, dynamism, and remote availability. There are no platforms that provide an immersive, educational, and personalized experience to explore university life without being physically on campus.

### Stakeholders and users

**Stakeholders:**

* Product Owner (course instructor)
* Coordinators and professors from ECCI
* Development teams participating in the course
* University outreach office

**User Types:**

* Prospective university applicants
* Interested members of the general public
* University community (faculty, administrative staff, students)


### Proposed solution

Develop a platform called ThemePark@UCR, accessible from web browsers and VR devices, that provides an interactive, immersive, and educational experience. This solution will allow users to explore the campus and learn about its services, academic programs, spaces, and activities in an accessible and engaging way through web and virtual reality technologies.


### Environment Analysis

* **Business Strategy:** Democratize access to knowledge and university life through emerging technologies such as virtual reality and interactive web platforms.

* **System Objectives:** Provide an accessible, interactive, and immersive portal for exploring the university campus and its academic offerings.

* **Business and Customer Perspective:** Current and prospective users will be able to learn about the university independently, in an attractive and modern way, enhancing academic decision-making.

* **Expected Use:** Web or VR navigation to explore 3D maps, complete missions or gamified activities, and access key information about services and academic programs.

* **Legacy Systems:** Institutional websites, UCR maps, and guided on-site campus visits.

* **Regulatory Aspects, Constraints, and Existing Solutions:** Compliance with digital accessibility standards, personal data protection regulations, and compatibility between web and VR technologies must be ensured.

## Technical decisions

### Methodologies Used and Defined Processes

The team will use the **Scrum** agile methodology, adapted to the academic environment, to manage the development of the ThemePark\@UCR system.

The project is divided into **four iterations (sprints)**:

* **Sprint 0:** Conceptualization and initial planning.
* **Sprints 1–3:** Development, testing, and integration of functionalities.

Each sprint will last approximately **3 weeks** and include the following ceremonies:

* **Daily Stand-ups:** To synchronize progress and identify blockers.
* **Sprint Planning:** Definition of tasks and objectives for each iteration.
* **Sprint Review:** Presentation of the completed functional increment.
* **Sprint Retrospective:** Review of the process and proposal of improvements.

Additionally, the following supporting practices will be applied:

* **Version control with Git**, using a branching strategy and code reviews through Pull Requests.
* **Task tracking via GitHub Projects**, organizing the backlog and sprint tasks on a Kanban board (with columns such as *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Review*, and *Done*).
* **Ongoing technical documentation**, including epics, acceptance criteria (DoD), system flows, and key decisions, all maintained in the repository and collaborative files.

### Artifacts Used in Project Development

* System conceptualization document
* User stories, epics, and product backlog
* Sprint task boards (GitHub Projects)
* Diagrams (architecture, database, etc.)
* Documented and versioned source code
* Configuration and deployment files
* Meeting logs and recorded decisions

### Code Repository and Git Strategy for the Project
The team uses Git as the version control system, following a strategy based on branch naming conventions according to the type of change. Guidelines are defined for branch naming, commit formatting, and pull request handling—all governed by the official repository guide.

Branches are managed according to the purpose of the change (new feature, bug fix, documentation, etc.) and are integrated through Pull Requests, which must meet both technical and functional review criteria.

> For more details, refer to the [GIT\_GUIDELINES.md](/Docs/Guidelines/GIT-GUIDELINES.md).

### Application Architecture

The application architecture is based on the clean architecture principles proposed by Robert Martin, known as Uncle Bob. Is based on the idea of organizing the code in layers, where each layer has a specific responsibility and is independent of the others. Below is a brief overview:

**Core Principles**

- Dependency Inversion: Business logic does not depend on infrastructure or external systems.
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Focuses on organizing software around the business domain.
- Abstractions at the Center: Dependencies point towards the core using interfaces.

**Layers**

- Domain Layer: Contains entities and core business rules.
- Application Layer: Implements workflows, use cases, and application-specific logic.
- Infrastructure Layer: Handles external concerns like data access and APIs.
- Presentation Layer: Manages user interactions and UI logic.

**S.O.L.I.D Principles**

- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion are followed to ensure clean and maintainable code.

**Coding Practices**

- Consistent naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables).
- Use of interfaces (I prefix) and private fields (_ prefix).
- To assist in the development of clean code, the team will use **SonarLint** tools to analyze the code and ensure adherence to best practices.

> For examples about this practices, refer to [Clean Architecture guidelines](/Docs/Guidelines/CA-GUIDELINES.md).

### Definition of Done (DoD)

A user story or task is considered “Done” when it meets all the established criteria and has been reviewed by the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) team. The criteria include:

* **Completed and approved acceptance criteria**, written in Gherkin format and covering positive, negative, and edge case scenarios. Stories must follow the INVEST principles.
* **Executed and validated tests**, including unit tests by the development team, and functional, integration, and regression tests reviewed by SQA.
* **Completed code review**, with at least two reviews: one technical (developer) and one functional (SQA). Copilot is used as the initial automatic validation.
* **Updated documentation**, including a description of the implemented functionality, test evidence, and reproduction steps.
* **Updated backlog status**, with changes reflected in the corresponding issues and task tracking board.

> For more details, refer to the [official SQA README](/Docs/Guidelines/SQA-GUIDELINES.md).

### Data Requirements

The ThemePark\@UCR system must manage structured data related to users, physical campus spaces, learning components, and academic entities. The most relevant types of data include:

* Personal information of users (students, administrative staff, visitors).
* Authentication and authorization data (users, roles, permissions).
* Representation of the campus physical structure (universities, campuses, areas, buildings, floors, learning spaces).
* Physical and virtual components within spaces (whiteboards, projectors, dimensions, locations).
* User preferences, interaction history, and personalized environment settings.

The data must comply with principles of integrity, uniqueness, and mandatory fields based on the type of entity, and must support relationships between real-world components in a Web/VR environment.

> For a complete overview of entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints, refer to the [`DB-DATA-REQUIREMENTS.md`](/Docs/Guidelines/DB-DATA-REQUIREMENTS.md) file in the official project repository.
